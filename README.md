# Hand Gesture Mouse Control

Control your computer's mouse using hand gestures detected by a webcam and your keyboard talking.  
This project uses Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe and SpeechRecognition to recognize gestures and what you say.

---

## Features
- activate the control mode by joining the index finger and the thumb and move the hand to move the mouse
- Click by closing your hand
- talk to write instead of using the keyboard

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+ (the code does not work with python 3.10+)
- Webcam
- Installed libraries:
  - opencv-python
  - mediapipe
  - pyautogui
  - SpeechRecognition
  ---

## Recommendations
- If you don't have python 3.10+ like me, I recommend to create a virtual environment and run the code there
- Make sure your webcam is connected and visible to Python.
- You can change the sensitivy of the mouse changing the value of the variable sensitivy in line 18 of the main code (main.py)
